# Internet Disabler
This program (if you bind it to an hotkey) will disable your internet connection, and if you press it.
Why you must say? Well for all of you who download random shits on Discord that are most probably viruses,
you can actively disable your internet connection to prevent the virus from sending your data to the hacker.

## How to use
1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/TaxMachine/internet-disabler/releases/tag/release)
2. Create a shortcut of the .exe file
3. Right-click on the shortcut and click on properties
4. In the "Shortcut" tab, click on shortcut key and press the key you want to bind it to
5. Press OK and you're done!
6. Press the key you bound it to and your internet connection will be disabled
